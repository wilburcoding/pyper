# Pyper
Simple typing practice GUI application with python

## How to install
You only need to install `matplotlib` using `pip install matplotlib` (Assuming you have the standard python libraries of `socket`, `threading`, `tkinter`, `uuid`)
Just run the `server.py` (the server for multiplayer games + leaderboard) and `main.py` for the actual application
